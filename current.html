    <p>The current Premier League season 2019-2020 is on hold due to the pandemic
    however Clubs are determined to get the season finished with no set end date in mind.
    Leicester are currently sat in 3rd place having played 29 games having won 16,drawn 5 and lost 8.
    They were on quite a bad run of form having only won 1 in the last 5 having drawn 2 and lost 2.
    There is some good news for Leicester as they do have a 5 point gap on the team closest Chelsea
    as well as a 8 point gap on Manchester United thus giving them a chance to remain in the Champions League places.
