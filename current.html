      <p>The Premier League season 2019-2020 did end up finishing in the end with Leicester finishing in 5th position after not having the best run of form after returning after 4 months.Leicester were sat in 3rd place having played 29 games having won 16,drawn 5 and lost 8 before lockdown and they were on quite a bad run of form having only won 1 in the last 5 having drawn 2 and lost 2.
        They did have a 5 point gap on Chelsea as well and an 8 point gap on Manchester United with many expecting the Champions League to be secure

    <h2 id="LeicesterPerform"> How Leicester ended up performing in their last few games.</h2>
    <p>
      Leicester currently have 9 games remaining in their season but only 5 dates were known prior to the postponement due to where they were in the FA Cup.I believe that Leicester will have a strong end of the season based off the known games available winning 3 against Brighton,Watford and Crystal Palace whilst drawing to Everton and Arsenal.
