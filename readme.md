# CTEC3905 Assignment

This is my website submission and I have chosen the topic of Leicester City Football Club for my site.

It has 4 pages being:
#index.html
#current.html
#future.html
#contacts.html
I have also included a CSS folder with the file called
#styles.css

I shall be attempting at some point to add some Javascript in with one being an alert which will appear when clicking the Logo to show the user that they've found a hidden link. As well as this I would like to add Google Maps implementation on the Contacts page.
