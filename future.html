      <p> In my opinion, Leicester City have had a very good 5 years since
        they won the Premier League Title in the 2015/2016 season being able to secure themselves as a top flight side finishing 12th in the next season before finishing 9th in two back to back seasons.Whilst they hadn't been able to establish the same attacking identity for a few years, Brendan Rodgers has got them back on the right track.They are currently on track to qualify for the Champions League for the 2nd time in their history which means that they need to invest in their squad.The image below is the current starting 11 going towards the end of the season.
